- 👋 Hi, I’m @neuroticks.
- 👀 I relish analyzing stock markets. My curiosity extends beyond the realm of numbers, leading me to explore a wide range of topics, from philosophy to building and nature. I have a budding interest in data science and machine learning, recognizing their potential to human wealth. Furthermore, I enjoy the challenge of programming in MetaTrader, crafting algorithms and strategies to navigate the ever-evolving market landscape.
- 🌱 I'm seeking a more comprehensive understanding of software development and therefore I'm updating myself on various fronts, as I had fallen behind in development technology around mid-2008/09 and now I want to regain that capability. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not now.. just learning..
- 📫 How to reach me ... try here at Github
